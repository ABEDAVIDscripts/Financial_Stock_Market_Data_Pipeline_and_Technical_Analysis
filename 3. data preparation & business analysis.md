## Data Preparation and Business Analysis


### 1.  Create a Table 
- Create temporary staging table (matches CSV structure)
```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_data_temp (
    date DATE,
    close DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_7 DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_14 DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_30 DECIMAL(10, 2),
    rsi DECIMAL(10, 2),
    rsi_signal VARCHAR(20),
    macd DECIMAL(10, 4),
    macd_signal_line DECIMAL(10, 4),
    histogram DECIMAL(10, 4),
    macd_crossover VARCHAR(10),
    recommendation VARCHAR(20)
);
```

- Create FINAL table with (Symbol COLUMN)
```bash
CREATE TABLE Final_stock_data (
    symbol      VARCHAR(10),
    date        DATE,
    close       DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_7       DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_14      DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sma_30      DECIMAL(10, 2),
    rsi         DECIMAL(10, 2),
    rsi_signal  VARCHAR(20),
    macd        DECIMAL(10, 4),
    macd_signal_line    DECIMAL(10, 2),
    histogram   DECIMAL(10, 4),
    macd_crossover      VARCHAR(10),

### 3. Data Preparation

1. Check for Duplicate

</div>

<BR>

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS duplicates, 
    symbol, date
FROM final_stock_data
GROUP BY symbol, date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

<br>

- Text error in APPL, UPDATE to AAPL
```SQL
UPDATE stock_data_cleaned
SET symbol = 'AAPL'
WHERE symbol = 'APPL';
```

<br>

- Duplicate found! Remove Duplicates using a BACKUP TABLE
```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_data_cleaned AS
SELECT *
FROM (
        SELECT 
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol, date ORDER BY macd DESC) as rn
        FROM final_stock_data
    )
WHERE rn = 1;
```

<br>

- verify
```sql
SELECT
    count(*) AS duplicates,
    symbol, date
FROM stocK_data_cleaned 
GROUP BY symbol, date
HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

<br>

- Count remaining data
```sql
SELECT
    count(*) AS datafile
FROM stocK_data_cleaned ;
```

<br>
<br>

2. Check for NULL Value

</div>


<br>

```sql
SELECT *

WHERE 
    date is NULL OR
    close IS NULL OR
    sma_7 IS NULL OR
    sma_14 IS NULL OR
    sma_30 IS NULL OR
    rsi IS NULL OR
